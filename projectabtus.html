    <h1>Mission and Purpose</h1>
    <p id="mispara">
     When we had to decide on a final project for our Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, we thought about how there are so many injustices in the world that are a long way from being solved. And while we were aware that one website will not be the catalyst that suddenly makes everyone drop their differences and accept each other, it does have the power to inform many. That became the goal of our project-- to cultivate change even at the smallest level.
   </p>
   <p id="mispara2">
We decided to focus on immigration because it is a very relevant issue, especially after the establishment of the Trump Administration. Most people are fed fake news that they hold on to without any significant evidence to support it. Our goals were to inform people about the true facts of immigration as well as to give people a feel of what it is actually like to be an immigrant in a more interactive way that can engage the audience. That’s why we decided on a factual board game.

America: “The land of opportunity”, as it is so commonly called. This is not the case anymore, with the widespread xenophobia in our country. Many fear that immigrants are stealing American jobs, yet research proves otherwise. According to The New Republic, In 2015 and 2016, more DREAMers have reported higher employment rates with the help of DACA.
Just like any other U.S. citizen, they have gained financial stability and paid their taxes.
The extra money they earned has allowed them to expand their growth within communities and develop businesses of their own thus offering more jobs opportunities for others. Furthermore, according to Francine D. Blau, an economics professor at Cornell University, there were “ […] no negative effects on overall wages and employment of native-born workers in the longer term.”

Our country has always been a place for people from around the world to seek refuge and start a new life. We have always held the belief that immigrants are what shape America into the beautiful country it is. In recent times, we cannot help but be aware of how hard it is for immigrants to enter our country and start a life here. The problems are only worsening under the Trump administration, and there is still a large amount of ignorance in the general populace about the issue. We have decided to take action and spread awareness ourselves about the unfair treatment of these people. Participating in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program has given us the power and opportunity to pursue this goal.

Quick Facts

-2,342 children have been separated from 2,206 parents at the US-Mexico border between May 5 and June 9 as part of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting people who cross the border illegally
</p>
<p id="quick3">
-91 percent of respondents are currently employed. Among respondents age 25 and older, employment jumps to 93 percent. This employment has a positive impact on American economy by increasing business creation and allowing Dreamers to open their own enterprises, creating more job opportunities.
